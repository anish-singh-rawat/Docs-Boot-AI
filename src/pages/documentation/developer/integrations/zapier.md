## Connecting with Zapier

Our user-friendly Zapier integration grants you the power to ask your DocsBot a question and receive an answer, complete with references or sources. Plus, you have complete control over how to input and output your question and answer.

We also have a Create Source action that allows you to add new content to your DocsBot via url, sitemap, or RSS feed.

### 1. Login or Signup to Zapier

Create a [free Zapier account](https://zapier.com/apps/docsbot-ai/integrations) if you don't already have one.

### 2. Create a Zap and Trigger

DocsBot can answer questions or write content in response to any trigger in your Zap. You ask a question, DocsBot delivers an answer. Or use the Create Source action to train your bot with new source content. Triggers can be from any app or service in the Zapier ecosystem.

[Connect DocsBot to 5,000+ apps](https://zapier.com/webintent/create-zap?create=true&entry-point-location=explore&entry-point-method=connect_call_to_action&steps%5B0%5D%5Bapp%5D=DocsBotAiCLIAPI%401.0.0)

Create your DocsBot (sign up here for free) by simply adding content like files or webpages, a process that takes less than two minutes.

Next, simply copy and paste your DocsBot's API Key, Team ID, and Bot ID by [selecting the bot to connect](https://docsbot.ai/app/bots), and clicking the "Sharing & API" link in your DocsBot dashboard. Zapier will request this information when setting up the DocsBot app. You can even create multiple connections to different DocsBots in your Zapier account, if you'd like.
